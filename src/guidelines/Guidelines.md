# MegaJobNepal Development Guidelines

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- VS Code (recommended)
- Git

### Initial Setup from VS Code

**‚ö° Quick Start (Recommended):**
```bash
npm run startup
```
This automated script handles everything for you!

**Manual Setup:**
1. **Clone and Open Project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd megajobnepal
   code .
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**
   - Visit `http://localhost:5173`
   - The app will automatically detect if database setup is needed

### First Time Setup

When you first visit the application:

1. **Database Setup Screen**
   - If you see "Database Setup" screen, click "Run Database Setup"
   - This creates demo data in localStorage (MongoDB-compatible)
   - Wait for completion (usually 2-3 seconds)

2. **Demo Accounts Created**
   - Job Seeker, Employer, Admin, and HR accounts are auto-created
   - All demo accounts bypass OTP verification

3. **Ready to Use**
   - Homepage will load with sample jobs and companies
   - Login with demo credentials (see testing section below)

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Website Not Loading
1. **Check Terminal for Errors**
   ```bash
   # Kill any existing processes
   pkill -f "vite"
   
   # Clear npm cache
   npm cache clean --force
   
   # Reinstall dependencies
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   
   # Start fresh
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Data**
   - Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`

3. **Port Issues**
   - If port 5173 is busy, Vite will auto-assign another port
   - Check terminal output for the correct URL

#### Database Setup Issues
1. **Clear Storage and Reset**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Manual Database Reset**
   - Delete all `mongodb_megajobnepal_*` keys from localStorage
   - Refresh page to trigger setup again

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Main development server
npm run dev                 # Start Vite dev server (port 5173)

# Alternative builds
npm run build              # Production build
npm run preview           # Preview production build

# Backend services (if needed later)
npm run dev:backend       # Start Express server
npm run dev:full         # Start both frontend and backend

# Database utilities
npm run migrate:mongodb   # Migrate to real MongoDB (future)
```

## MongoDB Connection Guide

### Current Setup (Browser-Based MongoDB Compatible Storage)

MegaJobNepal currently uses a MongoDB-compatible service that runs in the browser using localStorage as the storage backend. This provides the same MongoDB API interface for easy server deployment later.

#### How it Works:
1. **Local Storage Backend**: All data is stored in browser's localStorage
2. **MongoDB API Compatibility**: Uses the same method signatures as MongoDB
3. **Automatic Setup**: Database is automatically initialized on first run
4. **Demo Data**: Includes sample data for jobs, companies, users, etc.

#### Storage Structure:
```
localStorage keys:
- mongodb_megajobnepal_users (User accounts)
- mongodb_megajobnepal_companies (Company profiles)
- mongodb_megajobnepal_jobs (Job listings)
- mongodb_megajobnepal_job_categories (Job categories)
- mongodb_megajobnepal_applications (Job applications)
- mongodb_megajobnepal_skills (Skills database)
- mongodb_megajobnepal_subscriptions (Employer subscriptions)
```

### Migrating to Real MongoDB

When ready to deploy to production, follow these steps:

#### 1. Set Up MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)
1. Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster
3. Set up database user credentials
4. Whitelist your IP addresses
5. Get your connection string

#### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/megajobnepal?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DB_NAME=megajobnepal
```

#### 3. Update the Database Service
Replace `/lib/mongodb-fixed.ts` with a real MongoDB connection:

```typescript
import { MongoClient, Db } from 'mongodb';

class MongoDBService {
  private client: MongoClient;
  private db: Db;

  async connect() {
    this.client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI!);
    await this.client.connect();
    this.db = this.client.db(process.env.MONGODB_DB_NAME);
  }

  // Add your collection methods here
}
```

#### 4. Data Migration
Use the migration script to export localStorage data and import into MongoDB:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-to-mongodb.js
```

#### 5. Authentication Integration
Update authentication to use:
- JWT tokens with proper signing
- Real email service (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management

### Development vs Production

#### Development (Current):
- ‚úÖ Browser-based storage
- ‚úÖ Mock email service (console logs)
- ‚úÖ Demo accounts pre-created
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies

#### Production (Future):
- üîÑ Real MongoDB database
- üîÑ Email service integration
- üîÑ Proper JWT signing
- üîÑ Server-side authentication
- üîÑ File upload to cloud storage

System Guidelines

Use this file to provide the AI with rules and guidelines you want it to follow.
This template outlines a few examples of things you can add. You can add your own sections and format it to suit your needs

TIP: More context isn't always better. It can confuse the LLM. Try and add the most important rules you need

# General guidelines

Any general rules you want the AI to follow.
For example:

* Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default
* Refactor code as you go to keep code clean
* Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.

--------------

# Design system guidelines
Rules for how the AI should make generations look like your company's design system

Additionally, if you select a design system to use in the prompt box, you can reference
your design system's components, tokens, variables and components.
For example:

* Use a base font-size of 14px
* Date formats should always be in the format ‚ÄúJun 10‚Äù
* The bottom toolbar should only ever have a maximum of 4 items
* Never use the floating action button with the bottom toolbar
* Chips should always come in sets of 3 or more
* Don't use a dropdown if there are 2 or fewer options

You can also create sub sections and add more specific details
For example:


## Button
The Button component is a fundamental interactive element in our design system, designed to trigger actions or navigate
users through the application. It provides visual feedback and clear affordances to enhance user experience.

### Usage
Buttons should be used for important actions that users need to take, such as form submissions, confirming choices,
or initiating processes. They communicate interactivity and should have clear, action-oriented labels.

### Variants
* Primary Button
  * Purpose : Used for the main action in a section or page
  * Visual Style : Bold, filled with the primary brand color
  * Usage : One primary button per section to guide users toward the most important action
* Secondary Button
  * Purpose : Used for alternative or supporting actions
  * Visual Style : Outlined with the primary color, transparent background
  * Usage : Can appear alongside a primary button for less important actions
* Tertiary Button
  * Purpose : Used for the least important actions
  * Visual Style : Text-only with no border, using primary color
  * Usage : For actions that should be available but not emphasized
